# Black-Scholes-Method
The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used for pricing option contracts developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton. This model helps determine the theoretical price of European-style options, considering various factors that affect option pricing.

Assumptions of the Black-Scholes model:

1. European-Style options
2. Log-Normal distribution of stock prices
3. Constant Volatility
4. Efficient markets
5. Constant risk-free interest rate
6. No dividends

Components of the Black-Scholes Model are: 

1. Current Stock Price(S): This is the current market price of the underlying asset (index, stocks)
2. Strike Price(K): It is the determined price at which the option holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.
3. Time of Expiration(T): This represents the time remaining until the option contract expires.
4. Risk-Free interest rate(Rf): This is the interest rate of risk-free investment (T-bills interest rate for the period of the option).
5. Volatility (sigma): It measures the underlying asset's price fluctuation. In this model, it is assumed to be constant.

   The formula for calculating call option using the Black-Scholes Model:

I have taken the help of various resources available online to do the project. Playlists of the Black-Scholes model available on YouTube such as those of Mehul Mehta and Ryan Oâ€™Connell along with many more have been tremendously helpful.
